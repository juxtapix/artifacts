## Overview

In this precarious and critical time, it is important to expand and evolve our ecosystem of thought away from the current hierarchies that prioritize the established frameworks of the Anthropocene. There is vast potential in combining emerging technologies and artistic expression to re-envision possible futures and ways of knowing/learning. This 1 point class will introduce concepts of speculative design, design fiction, tactical media, and adversarial design through a post-dualistic non-eurocentric approach to designing futures.



## Format

This class will take shape as hands-on co-design workshops where students will learn about resilience as futurism and ideate, design, and develop artifacts for/from the future.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards. For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

## Statement on use of Electronic Devices

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.
